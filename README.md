# Papers implementation

I like to read and be inspired by the last reseach papers in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. 
In this repository, I am implementing the algorithms of those recent papers.

### 1. Images Style Transfert

Link:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf

Abstract: *"In ﬁne art,especially painting,humans have mastered the skills to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. [...] Here we introduce an artiﬁcial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artiﬁcial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery."* (From the paper)
